Use this checklist to reform your project handover process
Don’t let your project handovers turn into an overwhelming mess for your team.
Use this checklist to create a seamless process that keeps everyone on the same page and ensures a hiccup-free transition:

Step 1: Determine the details and create a project handoff document:
☐ Who is the point(s) of contact?
☐ What is everyone’s role in the project?
☐ What is the project scope?
☐ What is the timeline for deliverables?
☐ Provide any additional background information on the client
☐ What’s been done and delivered so far? (for project manager handoffs)
☐ What’s currently outstanding? (for project manager handoffs)
☐ Are there any issues or bottlenecks? (for project manager handoffs)
☐ What processes need to be followed? (for project manager handoffs)

Step 2: Prepare for the transition with a meeting
☐ Discuss the project handoff document, so everyone is on the same page and questions can be addressed
☐ Specify upcoming due dates, especially ones with a short turnaround time
☐ Update the project handoff document once the meeting is complete

Step 3: Start the transition
☐ Create a timeline including mini-milestones of how you plan to make the change happen
☐ Have your new team member shadow your existing project manager on conference calls and meetings
☐ Forward all email correspondences to the new project manager
☐ Have your new team member lead a meeting or conference call with your original project manager shadowing so they can give feedback and help build your new manager’s confidence
☐ Keep an eye on the transition for a few weeks, and you’ll be good to go

Use this process for every project handoff, and you’ll minimize stress and missed deadlines and keep your clients and team members happy.
